Sorry for this short update, but I am currently very busy developing the GameNigth game.
The current milestone is a functional Quake clone in a voxel level for next Monday.
To reach this goal the game still needs weapons and a lot of server code.
Underneath you can see a 2D drawing of a typical gameplay situation.

The left team's base consist of a small fortress with an automatic cannon on top, while the right teams base consist of a tall wall which extends far underground.
Underground an engineer is digging for the right base, while a light scout is rocket jumping over the middle house.

Hopefully I will soon be able to show real ingame footage!
