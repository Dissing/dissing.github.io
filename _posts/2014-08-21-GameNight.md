title: GameNight The Game!

Living on the country can be quite boring. Especially for a programmer as there are essentially no technical meetups. The only event we have which comes anywhere near "technical" is the biannual local LAN, which will be held next time on the 3 October. It is not huge averaging at about 100 people but we still have a tournaments with prizes and such. And its free! Which means we every year struggle to find funding for the electrical equipment. My job is usually to help with the power and network setup. But this time I am also working on a project which very few LAN events can boast of. This time we are getting our own game!

Yeah I *know* it currently looks very much like Minecraft...
The game will be a Quake-style CTF 5v5 but to facilitate dynamics levels it will be set in a Voxel world.The levels will consist of two symmetric halves separated by a huge wall. A team will get a fixed amount of time (3 minutes?) to build defensive structures and prepare their offensive. When the time has ran out, the wall will disappear and the combat can begin. The team to first bring in the enemy flag wins. Sounds simple right? The depth comes from the many different ways one can build a defensive and offensive. The goal is to put no limits and effectively allow the teams to play anyway they like. To give an example, one could start an offensive by digging a tunnel beneath the enemy base and attack them from behind. This can of cause be mitigated by digging a trench or burying mines. But there is no way one can mitigate every single offensive. As such it is a very tactical game requiring teamwork and smart thinking. 
Yeah I know I was already working on more projects than I could manage, but motivation is a strange thing. It is very hard to work on a project without some kind of motivation and right now I have nearly none motivation for working on robotics projects. Instead I chose to work on this time-limited project. This does not mean that the robotics project is cancelled. Just delayed until we can start the actual work (expected to be somewhere after autumn break).
