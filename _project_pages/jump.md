Jump is a mobile game under development by me and a friend. He makes the graphics while I am responsible for the coding. The game is developed using [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and we therefore expect to target Android, IOS and maybe even Facebook. Due to summer vacation the development is currently on hold, but is expected to start again in begining of September.
